# Glossary

## Modern programming can be quite confusing with an array of phrases that go beyond syntax and language specifics, here are a few of the more abstract concepts.

**_Duck Typing &mdash;_**

**_Function Currying &mdash;_**<br>

**_Tail Recursion &mdash;_**<br>
Recursion chews up a valuable and limited resource, the stack, and can lead to an unrecoverable type error: overflow. Tail Recursion however is a form of recursion that can avoid exceeding stack space during its execution. This means tail call optimization is slightly faster (no stack pushes or pops are required) and overflow exceptions are avoided.

**_Functional Programming &mdash;_**

**_Monkey Patching &mdash;_**
Modifying, extending or otherwise overwriting a language's core class or module. Generally not recomended due to the possibility of corrupting expected behaviour, whenever possible it is better to have a new class.

**_Encapsulation, Single Responsibility Principle & Closures &mdash;_**

**_Polyfill, Shim & Mixins &mdash;_**
